							<p>For my creative aspect, I would like to disply the website I designed for my undergraduate club which can be found <a <a href="http://vtsips.com">here</a>. As an English student, I cultivated this website for the Student Intellectual Property Society. This club takes my major and expands it towards my minors, combining Chemistry, Science Engineering and Law, and Professional Technical Writing. With this in mind, growing the V and T shaped student was effortless.</p>
							<p>I support the VT Shaped Student as it furthers my academic and intellectual pursuits. While branching out with the knowledge gained from website production and coding, I can further my core education and bolster my degree. The ability to expand outside of the classroom and create a club focused on my academic interests has proved invaluable. I have learned a lot about leadership skills, management, and coordinating large groups of students. Without the introduction of the VT shaped student, none of these opportunities would have come to fruition.</p>
							<p>With the creation of this website, large organizations took our small group seriously. This expanded the opportunities available to our club and provided us with a trip to the Patnet Office. Furthering the V shaped experience, we attened a Patent Trial and Appeals Board meeting (PTAB), as well as visited Catholic Law School and even VORYS Intellectual Property Firm.</p>
							<p>Taking my major of chemistry and branching out in T shaped fashion to include coding and web design furthered my abilities as a student. Learning how to develop member profiles, club applications, newsletters, and even a donation section has expanded my coding horizions and furthered me as a well rounded Virginia Tech student.</p>
